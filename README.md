Idea Description: As animal lovers, we sometimes feel pity of the stray animals and feel very disgusted looking at their condition on the roads in the case of mishappenings. So instead of just looking at them and mourning, the better idea will be to take some action which will be helpful for them. One such step is contacting the nearest NGO. So, any person who witnesses such an animal on the roads, can open our website or app and drop a message with a photograph to the nearest NGO and also share his/her location. Also some people are no longer wanting to keep their animals in case of some injury or disease due to lack of education. Such people can visit our website or app and list their animal on the platform and anyone who is interested in adopting the animal can do the same thing on our platform. In such a way, we can do our best in saving the animals. #ResqueWalk
